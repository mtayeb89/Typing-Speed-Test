# 💻 Typing Speed Test Application

## Description
A sophisticated Typing Speed Test application built with Python and Tkinter, designed to measure and improve typing skills. This interactive tool provides real-time feedback on typing speed (Words Per Minute) and accuracy.

## ✨ Features
- Random paragraph generator
- Real-time Words Per Minute (WPM) calculation
- Typing accuracy tracking
- Simple and intuitive user interface
- Reset functionality
- Instant performance feedback

## 🖥️ Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

## 🔧 Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/typing-speed-test.git
cd typing-speed-test
```

### 2. Run the Application
```bash
python typing_speed_test.py
```

## 🎮 How to Use
1. The application will display a random paragraph
2. Start typing the paragraph in the text area
3. The app automatically calculates:
   - Words Per Minute (WPM)
   - Typing Accuracy
4. Click "Reset Test" to start a new test

## 📊 Metrics Explained
- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: 
  - Measures typing speed
  - Calculated by number of words typed divided by time elapsed
- **Accuracy**: 
  - Percentage of correctly typed characters
  - Compares typed text with original paragraph

## 🚀 Customization

### Adding More Paragraphs
Edit the `paragraphs` list in the code to include more typing texts:
```python
self.paragraphs = [
    "Your new paragraph here...",
    # Add more paragraphs
]
```
